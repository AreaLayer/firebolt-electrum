**CoinJoin Process:**

 1. Peer Discovery: Discover peers and establish connections.
 
 2. CoinJoin Request: Send CoinJoin requests to peers and await responses.
 
 3. Transaction Creation and Signing: If peers acknowledge the CoinJoin request, create and sign the CoinJoin transaction.
    
 4. Broadcasting: Broadcast the final CoinJoin transaction to the Bitcoin network.

 5. Finalization: Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the Bitcoin network.
